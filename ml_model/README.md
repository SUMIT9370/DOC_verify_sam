# Custom Machine Learning Model

## Instructions

1.  **Place Your Model Files Here**: Copy all the necessary files for your machine learning model (e.g., `.py` files, `.pkl` model weights, etc.) into this `/ml_model` directory.

2.  **Create `requirements.txt`**: If your model has any Python dependencies (like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.), create a file named `requirements.txt` inside this `/ml_model` directory and list all the packages your model needs.

Once you have placed your files here, let me know, and I will proceed with integrating the model into the application.
